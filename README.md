This terrible little tool is for hotpatching the JDK.
Sometimes you disagree with Oracle, and think you are better at doing things, so you get out your knife.
This tool allows you to take the bits you think that you know more about, and replace classes in the JDK.
Everytime I've done this, it's had terrible consequences, but in some super limited cases, it's very useful.

Just because you have a jackhammer, doesn't mean you should dig up the street so you can have more fun in your 4x4.
